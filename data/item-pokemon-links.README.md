# Item-Pokemon Links

This file (`item-pokemon-links.json`) contains the relationships between items and Pokémon for display on their respective pages.

## Structure

```json
{
  "pokemonToItems": {
    "pokemonId": ["itemId1", "itemId2", ...]
  },
  "itemToPokemon": {
    "itemId": ["pokemonId1", "pokemonId2", ...]
  }
}
```

## Regenerating

The file is automatically generated by running:

```bash
npm run generate-links
```

This searches all item descriptions for Pokémon names and vice versa, using word boundary matching to avoid false positives.

## Manual Editing

You can manually add or remove connections as needed:

### To add a link between a Pokémon and an item:

1. Add the item ID to the pokemon's array in `pokemonToItems`
2. Add the pokemon ID to the item's array in `itemToPokemon`

Example - linking Pikachu to Light Ball:
```json
{
  "pokemonToItems": {
    "pikachu": ["lightball"]
  },
  "itemToPokemon": {
    "lightball": ["pikachu"]
  }
}
```

### To remove a link:

Simply remove the ID from both arrays.

## Notes

- IDs are lowercase with no special characters (e.g., "Mr. Mime" → "mrmime")
- Both directions must be maintained manually (pokemonToItems AND itemToPokemon)
- After editing, rebuild the site with `npm run serve` to see changes
